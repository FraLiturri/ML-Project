Ideas: 
Can for loop be inserted directly in .Backpropagation() method?

TO DO: 
Change some var names (single_output) to a clearer one; 
Better (clearer) Var def. in hidden_layers, hidden units; 
Random numbers don't change after every launch: solved this;  
Add a method called RandomTraining() for last hidden trianing (see slieds on randon NN); 

TO DO (info.py): 
Add general info getter
