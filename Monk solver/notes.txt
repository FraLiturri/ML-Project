Instead of using matrices for weights, use a vector, taking only the first N
entries for the first layer, the successive M for the second and so on. 

There's a command in Eigen that takes matrix (n*m) rows and with them creates a vector with n*m entries;  

TO DO: 
substitute VectorXd with Vector<double, N> where the size of the vector is well-known;
